## Description

_This web application will ask the user for a number. The application will create a list of numbers starting with zero all the way to the respective input number. The number 3 will be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?", the number 2 will be replaced with "Boop!", and the number 1 will be replaced with "Beep!". The hierarchy is such that 3 takes precedent over 2 and 1, and the number 2 takes precedent of 1. If a number has more than one digit the higher number of the three will be replaced with the respective substitution._
